Known Bugs:
	None.



Disclaimer:
	You will see duplicate items at the take order screen.
	The reason for this is because Menu.cfg is loaded with
	many of the same items. The reason for this is to show our
	paginated display at the take order screen. Feel free to delete
	any items from the menu.
	
	Beware when editing Stage.cfg. Remember, if youre going to add a stage,
	all the items now need a time for that stage, excluding driver/delivery.

	If you want to view all the orders in the Daily Order tab after searching
 	for a customer, all text from the phone number field must be cleared and
	find customer must be pressed.

	If you specify a stage with 0 workers, the simulation will not progress pass that
	stage. All stages must have at least one worker in order for orders to be fully processed
	to the end.

	-Config files for configurable menu and stages
		The most important configuration files that truly express our
		programs configurability are in the config folder with the names
		Stage.cfg and Menu.cfg. Menu relies on Stage because Stage lets you determine
		how many different Stages there can be. For example, there can be a prepping
		stage, a cooking/oven stage, glazing stage etc. The reason Menu.cfg relies on
		this is because the number of stages is directly linked to the items on the menu,
		where if a stage is specified a corresponding time for that stage for each item
		must also be specified. For example, if I say I want a glazing stage and add it
		to Stage.cfg, all my items in Menu.cfg must also now have glazing time specified.
		The order of the stages is determined by there order listed in the config file.
		Each stage in Stage.cfg has multiple properties each seperated by a comma.

		Stage.cfg format
		Argument 1: The name of the stage or job, 
		Argument 2: The number of workers in that stage 
		Argument 3: How many items that worker can hold, write a negative number if it doesn't matter.
		Argument 4: True if this worker works with orders rather items. For example, an oven
			    can split up an order by multiple items, while drivers must deliver whole orders.

		Menu.cfg format
		Argument 1: The name of the item. 
		Argument 2: The Price of the item.
		Argument 3.The number of space units, 
		Argument 4: true if this item can have toppings,
		Argument 5....N: The time it takes per stage, must be equal to the number of Stages not including the delivery stage in Stage.cfg, 
		#DO NOT account for the Driver Time!!!#
		Remember that the delivery time is not handled on a stage by stage basis, but depends on
		the customer, so it is not variable time that should be specified. The simulation handles it.

		database/Toppings.db:
		Argument 1: Name of topping.
		Argument 2. Price of topping.

	-Placing an order
		-When you open the system, you are automatically brought
		 to the customer search screen. Type the the phone number
		 of the calling customer. If they are in the database, the 
		 name and location should automaticall fill in after the 
		 number is entered (press enter after all 10 digits have been entered)
		 After customer information has been given, select start order.
		 choose the desired items and toppings and select process order 
		 (or done choosing topping and then process order). The order will then process

	-Viewing current orders
		-Select the View Current Orders tab. By default, all of the current and completed 
		 orders for the day are shown. You can choose to sort the orders by customer if you type
		 in the customer's phone number in the number box or by stage if you select the scrolldown bar.
		 upon clicking on an order, the order's information should appear on the right hand side. 
	-view manager logs
		-Select the manager tab and then select the View Logs tab. By default all of the processed orders

		 new employee (which prompts you to create a new account), promote an already existing employee who is not already a manager, or fire(remove)
		 a current employee. Note: One admin(manager) must be on the list at all times.
